<h2>About</h2>
<p>This Movement Database is part of the M+M: Movement + Meaning Middleware project, which is intended to enable researchers to construct meaningful semantic models for movement that can interpret human movement data, construct machine-learning models for movement recognition and movement analytics, represent semantic properties of movement behaviours for virtual avatars in online games and online performance, and map movement data as a controller for online navigation, collaboration, distributed performance and as input to search engines that can recognize and tag existing movement databases.</p> 
<p>The M+M: Movement + Meaning Middleware project is a collaboration between <a href="http://sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a> at the <a href="http://siat.sfu.ca">School of Interactive Arts + Technology</a> in partnership with <a href="http://www.credo-interactive.com/">Credo Interactive</a>, an SME developing animation and choreographic software for human movement, and <a href="http://hplustech.com">H+Technologies</a>, creators of customizable intuitive gesture based systems & holographic displays. The M+M: Movement + Meaning middleware will also be utilized in the team of researchers that are supported by the SSHRC international partnership entitled <a href="http://movingstories.ca">MovingStories</a>: Digital tools for movement, meaning and interaction.</p>
